/**
 * A functional interface that must be implemented by any application using the
 * resource management library to provide access to the currently authenticated user's ID.
 * <p>
 * This interface decouples the library from any specific authentication or user context implementation,
 * allowing the consuming application to define how and where the user ID is retrieved fromâ€”such as
 * a Spring Security context, a thread-local storage, or a custom authentication service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code UserResourceManagementProvider} is typically exposed as a Spring {@code @Bean}
 * in the consuming application. The resource management library will automatically detect and
 * inject this bean to retrieve user-specific information for features like caching or rate limiting.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example usage in a Spring Boot application
 *
 * @Configuration
 * public class ResourceManagementConfig {
 *
 *     @Bean
 *     public UserResourceManagementProvider userResourceManagementProvider() {
 *         return () -> SecurityContextHolder.getContext()
 *                                           .getAuthentication()
 *                                           .getName(); // or any other custom logic
 *     }
 * }
